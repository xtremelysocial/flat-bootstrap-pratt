Pratt by XtremelySocial is an adaptation of the "Pratt" theme by Blacktie.co. It is a modern, fully responsive, "flat" style theme with a nice color palette, big full-width images, and full-width colored sections. The navbar is fixed at the top of the page for easy navigation. It includes several beautiful header images for businesses, photographers, musicians, writers and you can upload your own as well.

== DESCRIPTION ==

The Pratt theme is a child theme for Flat Bootstrap that fixes the navbar to the top of the page and includes your site title. The theme comes with several beautiful full-width header images and you can also upload your own. 

The theme is great for business sites, showcasing products, portfolios, or photos. The included header images are designed for businesses, photographers, musicians, and writers / bloggers.

This theme supports a "static" home page and full-width pages and posts, but you can use it in the more traditional blog-style with sidebars.
 
Other features include a mobile navigation bar, multiple columns (grid), buttons, icons, labels, badges, tabbed content areas, collapsible content areas, progress bars, alert boxes, carousels (sliders) and much, much more. This is a theme for both users and theme developers with lots of features but without the bloat.

== INSTALLATION ==

1. Download and install the parent theme, Flat Bootstrap, into your main /wp-content/themes/ directory
2. Download this theme into your main /wp-content/themes/ directory
3. Activate this theme through the 'Appearance' menu in WordPress
4. Read the notes below about how to use this theme


== HOW TO USE THIS THEME ==

= Setting up the Home Page =

We think this theme looks great with the home page as a full-width page with midnight blue "section header" that has a screenshot or picture of your product, service, or latest work at the top. So we have provided a sample home page that you can import into your theme. Use the standard WordPress Import feature and load the /samples/samples.xml file. You can use this sample to build your home page (or any other page on your site).

If you want this page to be your home page, create or edit an existing page to be used for your blog. You don't need any content or special settings on that page as its just a placeholder URL for WordPress to display your blog. Then go into WordPress Appearance -> Customize and set the option for Static Home Page to one of your pages. Assign this page as your blog page.

= Optionally, Set up the Theme as a Single Page Site =

The original Pratt HTML theme by Blacktie.com is a "single page" theme, meaning the home page is a long series of sections that covers what normally would be broken into several pages. For example, sections for about us, our products, our services, our team, how to contact us, etc. To aid navigation the main menu contains links to the various sections and when clicked a "smooth scroll" effect is used to move the user to the top of the selected section.

This theme can absolutely be used that way, but you don't have to. Most WordPress sites have multiple pages, so the theme defaults to working that way, but here is how to set that up.

Follow the directions above about setting up the home page or if using your own, be sure to include an ID on each section you want to link to.

Then set up the primary navigation menu with a set of custom links. In the Appearance -> Menus screen, select "Links" instead of the default "Pages". The "URL" should point to the home page with a "#" sign and the ID of the section, such as "#about". Key in the title, such as "About", then add the menu item. Then click on the menu item to edit it. Place the word "smoothscroll" (without the quotes) in the Title Attribute field. That will trigger a cool scrolling effect on the link when its clicked.

Note that once you set up the menu this way, you are truly limited to linking to a single page. If you add regular page or category links, once a user goes to that page, clicking the main navbar items above won't work because they are no longer on the home page. That's primarily why we haven't set it up to work this way out of the box.

= Set up the Footer =

The original Pratt HTML theme by Blacktie.co has a two-column footer with your organization's address on the left and a contact form on the right. So we've gone ahead and set that as the default when you first install the theme. However, that is just a sample. You'll want to add widgets with your own information in them.

Add a normal WordPress text widget to the Footer sidebar and key in your company name and address or whatever you like.

To duplicate the contact form, you must enable the Jetpack Feedback module. Add a second text widget to the Footer sidebar and paste in the following. This is a standard WordPress contact form that will send the email contents to the "Feedback" section in Admin and also email it to you.

`[contact-form][contact-field label='Name' type='name' required='1'/][contact-field label='Email' type='email' required='1'/][contact-field label='Website' type='url'/][contact-field label='Comment' type='textarea' required='1'/][/contact-form]`

You can change up the fields and labels and even add new ones. To customize the form, just go to any page on your site and click the "Add Contact Form" button. After you insert the form into your page, just cut-and-paste that [contact-form] shortcode into your text widget.

= About WordPress Child Themes =

This theme is a standard WordPress "child theme". It comes with only the files that modify the styling, templates, and functions of the parent theme that are needed for this theme.

If you just want to change some of the styling (CSS), we recommend using the WordPress Jetpack plugin for this. It will store your styles in the WordPress database and apply them automatically after the theme's default styles.

If you want to modify the theme further than that, such as to modify page templates, then COPY this theme into your /wp-content/themes directory with a new directory name. Perhaps pratt-modified or my-pratt or something like that. You'll also need to change the very first line of the style.css file to change the "Theme Name:" so that you can tell the difference between the original Pratt theme and your customized one when you are viewing the themes on your site.

By using either of these methods described above (the Jetpack plugin or copying the theme files to a new name), you'll be able to upgrade this theme from WordPress.org to receive bug fixes and new features and incorporate those into your own child theme if you'd like.

You can read more information about how to use child themes on WordPress.org [http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes]

= Additional Theme Features and Usage =

All of the features of the parent theme, Flat Bootstrap, are included in this theme. You can have full-width images at the top of your pages, full-width blog posts (no sidebar), colored sections, buttons, carousels (sliders), and much, much more. 

For more information, see the "How to use our themes" [http://xtremelysocial.com/wordpress/usergide/] and the "Theme Shortcodes" [http://xtremelysocial.com/wordpress/shortcodes/] pages on our website. 


== CHANGELOG ==

= 1.5 =
* Updated sidebar-footer.php and sidebar-pagebottom.php to always fire the sidebar filters even if there are no widgets added by the user. That way they an be overridden by plugins if desired.
* Load parent theme's (Flat Bootstrap) style.css using PHP instead of CSS inline @include. This improves performance of the theme.
* Enhanced the custom site title color to work even if someone overrides the top navbar from navbar-default (light background) to navbar-inverse (dark background).
* Removed reference to Blacktie.co from the site credits that automatically display at the bottom of the theme. They are still credited in this readme.txt file of course.
* Updated the comments in functions.php to reflect the new option for custom header location (not used by this theme).
* We now completely override the parent theme's xsbf_custom_header_setup() because when v2.0 of Flat Bootstrap is released, it will have its own custom headers. 
* Remove theme support for custom logo (for now) in preparation for Flat Bootstrap v2.0.
* Add post-thumbnail-default.png to /images folder in preparation for Flat Bootstrap v2.0.
* Updated theme screenshot to the new "2x" WordPress format (1200x900px).
* Rearranged the style.css and added a table of contents to it.

= 1.4 =
* Added the ability to turn off displaying the site title in the top nav bar.
* Added the ability to change the color of the site title in the top nav bar.
* Changed the default header background to the city view as that is the one that is in the theme's screenshot.
* Updated the calls to the various sidebars to use the sidebar ID instead of the name to avoid issues with language translations that change the name.

= 1.3 =
* Added $xsbf_theme_option to control displaying the custom header below the navbar. Removed content-header.php and header.php as those are no longer needed because the parent theme handles this now.
* Added new custom header image of a desktop with briefcase
* Added new custom header image of a city skyline
* Changed sample comment form in footer to not require Jetpack. This was displaying as ugly shortcodes in theme preview.
* Bumped version numbers.
* Includes all the latest enhancements from the parent theme, such as support for portfolios and testimonials, new page templates, full-width embedded videos, expanded color palette, and much more.

= 1.2 =
* Change name to Pratt from Flat Bootstrap Pratt per WordPress.org recommendation
* Remove features from this child theme that are now incorporated into the parent theme, Flat Bootstrap
* Updated content header to better determine what image and text to display
* Added images to the samples.xml file so the user can choose to import them if desired

= 1.1 =
* Final updates for inclusion in the WordPress.org Theme Directory
* Allows user to change the background image and/or background color and it now applies to the page itself, not just outside the page borders
* Leaves images on pages that aren't full width alone so they display as normal images rather than being stretched full width

= 1.0.2 =
* Additional updates for inclusion in the WordPress.org Theme Directory

= 1.0.1 =
* Updates for inclusion in the WordPress.org Theme Directory

= 1.0 =
* Initial version
